# Breaking-bad
A React application built with Typescript and Parcel which shows the cast of Breaking Bad and their information. Inspired from Traversy Media's Breaking Bad API YouTube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaioUnMw0mo. I wanted to a build a React App without create-react-app and Parcel seemed like a good option. Using TypeScript was a bit tricky e.g. needed special ts.config to import ".jpg" files etc. I can understand why TypeScript is the new hype, type security leads to better code readability and assurance.
